<h1>How can I tell if someone has a mental health problem</h1>
<p>
You can’t always tell if someone has a mental illness – people
might look as though they’re fine and doing well, when actually they’re silently struggling.

If someone has bipolar disorder, they may show significant mood swings, or appear more withdrawn if they are dealing
with self-harm or negative thoughts, but everything is dependent on the individual and there is no one way to know
whether someone is unwell.</p>

<h1>How can I speak to and help someone with a mental health problem like depression or anxiety</h1>
<p>
Encourage them to seek help
Don’t be afraid to bring it up
Don’t blame them
Be patient
Look after yourself
</p>

<p>If you’re feeling suicidal or are concerned about someone else, confide in someone you know, contact your GP, call 999,
go to A&E or call the Samaritans (116 123).</p>

</p>

<h1>diagnoses</h1>
<p>

    A medical history,
    A physical exam and possibly lab tests, 
    A psychological evaluation. </p>

    <h1>Treatment</h1>
    <p>If you have a mild mental illness with well-controlled symptoms, treatment from your primary care provider may be
    sufficient. However, often a team approach is appropriate to make sure all your psychiatric, medical and social needs
    are met.</p>
